a. Creation of promotion

6.1 Create Promotion

Promotions are divided into two types: Bonus and Rebate.

Bonus promotion: After the player applies, the bonus and deposit amount will be transferred to the promotion wallet directly. Players must play at the game provider selected by the operator before the system will calculate player turnover. 

The promotion wallet will be closed only when
 1. turnover is reached 
2. The promotion wallet balance is zero
3. The promotion wallet balance is lower than the amount you set.

Rebate promotion: Players can directly receive the rebate bonus from the main walletã€‚


Register Bonus
When players register on the player site, they are eligible to apply for a register  bonus, which will be sent to the player's promotion wallet in a fixed amount.
Since it is a register bonus, players can only apply for it once per account. If the player applies again, the system will reject the application automatically.
Since the registration bonus is easy for players to exploit system loopholes, they can repeatedly receive bonuses by creating new accounts. You can prevent it from setting up in Risk Control . If the player account has the same information as the account that previously applied for the discount, the system will directly prevent the player from applying for the discount. For example, the same login IP, the same phone number, the same email address, and the same bank account number are not allowed. 

Three conditions for completing the promotion wallet

1. Achieve the turnover amount set by the operator.  
Players must play on game providers selected by the operator, and the player's turnover will be calculated by the system. And when the turnover reaches the amount specified by the operator, the promotion wallet will automatically end, and the balance in the promotion wallet will be directly transferred to the player's main wallet.

2. The promotion wallet balance is zero. 
When the player loses all the balance in the promotion wallet, the promotion wallet will automatically complete.

3. The balance is lower than the "Auto Complete Amount". 
In the promotion settings, there is a setting called "Auto Complete Amount". When the balance in the player's promotion wallet is lower than the amount set by the operator, the promotion wallet will automatically complete.


Promotion Field Description

Language

The operator can set up multiple languages. When the player switches the language on the player site, the content of the promotion will be changed according to the language selected by the player on the player site.

The operator needs to fill in the "default" content first when creating a promotion. You can then click "Add" to select the language the operator needs to add. Because it is the same promotion event, the operator only adds a new language, so he only needs to fill in the promotion content, and the promotion settings do not need to be reset.
